Overview of CMPG 323 and all its projects

1 Project Structure for semester:
One OVERVIEW Repo (this repo) will be linked to all projcets and other repos that forms part of the CMPG 323 projects 2-5. //Name(CMPG-323-OVERVIEW-34962913)
For each project 2-5, I will create a repository, thus 4 different repositories not including the overview repository
Thus for project 2 there will be a repository called:  "Project2 Repo"
     for project 3 there will be a repository called:  "Project3 Repo"
     for project 4 there will be a repository called:  "Project4 Repo"
     for project 5 there will be a repository called:  "Project5 Repo"
