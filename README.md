# CMPG-323-OVERVIEW-34962913
Overview of CMPG 323 and all its projects

1 Project Structure for semester:
One OVERVIEW Repo (this repo) will be linked to all projcets and other repos that forms part of the CMPG 323 projects 2-5. //Name(CMPG-323-OVERVIEW-34962913)
For each project 2-5, I will create a repository, thus 5 different repositories not including the overview repository
Thus for project 2 there will be a repository called:  "Project2 Repo"
     for project 3 there will be a repository called:  "Project3 Repo"
     for project 4 there will be a repository called:  "Project4 Repo"
     for project 5 there will be a repository called:  "Project5 Repo"
     for POE there will be a repository called: "POE"

2 Branching Strategy:
I will have a main or master branch and then also a develop or dev branch, changes will be made on the dev branch and then merged onto the main or master branch.

3 .gitignore: 
I will use gitignore to ignore certain files when my projects are being commited. 
I will ignore files that are not part of my project. 


 Credentials stored: 
 I will use gitignore to ignore the files that contains usernames and passwords, preventing them to be accessed by the public. I will use git-credential-store to store  password, protected by persmisions of the file system and save credentails in plaintext files on the cloud.
